# My First Django Project 🐍✨

Just a humble little project I threw together while learning Django.  
Definitely not production-ready — unless you're okay with duct tape and debug mode on 😅

Mostly just playing around with:
- Settings that barely make sense
- A database that cries every time I run `migrate`
- CI/CD that works… sometimes

Feel free to poke around! Feedback, memes, and coffee are all welcome.
